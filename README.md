- **Problem Database**: LeetCode API  
- **AI Integration**: Groq API  

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js (v16+)](https://nodejs.org/)  
- npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### ✅ Check Your Setup

```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chethanreddy10/ZCoder.git
cd ZCoder
```

---

### Step 2: Set Up the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` directory:

```env
MONGODB_URI="connection-string of mongoDB"/Zcoder(so that if initailly not present then it will be created in your cluster).
PORT=3000
GROQ_API_KEY=

```

#### 🔑 To get your Groq API Key:

1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to **API Keys**
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy and paste it into the `.env` file

Start the backend server:

```bash
nodemon index.js
```

✅ You should see: `Server running on port 3000`

---

### Step 3: Set Up the Frontend

In a **new terminal**:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `frontend` directory:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://leetcode-api-mu.vercel.app/
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_JUDGE=https://emkc.org/api/v2/piston/execute
```

Start the frontend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

✅ You should see: `http://localhost:5173`

---

## 🌐 Access the Application

Visit in your browser: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Command not found"

Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.  
Check with:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

---

### ❌ Port Already in Use

- For backend: Change port or kill process using port 3000  
- For frontend: Vite suggests an alternative port automatically

---

### ❌ Environment Variables Not Working

- Ensure files are named `.env`, not `.env.txt`
- Located in correct directories
- Restart both servers after creating

---

### ❌ Dependency Installation Fails

```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

---

### ❌ CORS Errors

- Make sure backend is running at `http://localhost:3000`
- Verify frontend `.env` has correct `VITE_BACKEND_URL`
